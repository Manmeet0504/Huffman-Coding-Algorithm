# Huffman Coding Algorithm

Huffman coding is a widely used data compression algorithm that enables efficient representation of data using variable-length codes. It was developed by David A. Huffman in 1952 while he was a graduate student at MIT. The main goal of Huffman coding is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data, thus achieving compression. The algorithm works by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols or characters in the data and longer codes to less frequent symbols. This creates a variable-length prefix code, where no code is a prefix of another code, ensuring that the codes can be uniquely deciphered.
