        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Huffman coding</strong> is a widely used data compression
          algorithm that enables efficient representation of data using
          variable-length codes. It was developed by
          <strong>David A. Huffman</strong> in 1952 while he was a graduate
          student at MIT. The main goal of Huffman coding is to reduce the
          number of bits needed to represent data, thus achieving compression.
          The algorithm works by assigning shorter codes to more frequently
          occurring symbols or characters in the data and longer codes to less
          frequent symbols. This creates a variable-length prefix code, where no
          code is a prefix of another code, ensuring that the codes can be
          uniquely deciphered.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          The steps involved in the Huffman coding algorithm are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Frequency Count:</strong> The algorithm starts by analyzing
            the input data and counting the frequency of occurrence of each
            symbol or character.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Create Huffman Tree:</strong> The symbols are then organized
            into a binary tree, called the Huffman tree. Initially, each symbol
            is treated as a separate tree with its frequency as the weight. The
            two trees with the lowest frequencies are combined to form a new
            tree, and this process is repeated until all the symbols are part of
            the tree.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Assign Codes:</strong> Traverse the Huffman tree to assign
            codes to each symbol. The codes are generated by assigning a 0 to
            each left branch and a 1 to each right branch as you move from the
            root to a specific symbol in the tree.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Encoding:</strong> Replace each symbol in the input data
            with its corresponding Huffman code. The resulting binary string is
            the compressed representation of the input data. repeated until all
            the symbols are part of the tree.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Decoding:</strong> To decompress the data, use the same
            Huffman tree used for encoding to map the Huffman codes back to
            their original symbols.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>For Compressing:</strong></li>
          <img class="image-container" src="./encoding.png" />
          <li><strong>For Decompressing:</strong></li>
          <img class="image-container" src="./decoding.png" />
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>inputFile.txt (1.81 MB) is compressed to
          compressedFile.huf (982 KB) file and decompressed back to
          ouputFile.txt (1.81 MB).
        </p>
        <div><img class="small" src="./input.png" /></div>
        <br />
        <div><img class="small" src="./compressed.png" /></div>
        <br />
        <div><img class="small" src="./output.png" /></div>
        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong>This project is just an implementation of
          Huffman coding, it is not as efficient as the compression algorithm
          used currently to compress files.
